/**
 * Uploads browser sourcemaps to AppSignal's private sourcemap endpoint.
 *
 * Private rather than public: the maps embed the original source
 * (`sourcesContent`), so serving them next to the chunks would publish the
 * frontend. The build strips them from the image; this puts them somewhere only
 * AppSignal can read.
 *
 * AppSignal resolves a backtrace by matching the *full URL* of the minified
 * file, so each map is uploaded against the public URL of the chunk it belongs
 * to — which is why the environment's origin is an input. Matching is also
 * scoped by `revision`: it must be the same commit that is baked into the image
 * as APP_REVISION, or a map is stored and never used.
 *
 * Plain Node with no dependencies on purpose — this runs in CI against the
 * exported maps, without installing the monorepo.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   APPSIGNAL_PUSH_API_KEY=... APPSIGNAL_APP_NAME="Zemio Web" \
 *   APPSIGNAL_APP_ENV=staging APP_REVISION=<sha> \
 *   ASSET_ORIGIN=https://staging.zemio.co \
 *   node apps/web/scripts/upload-sourcemaps.mjs [sourcemapDir]
