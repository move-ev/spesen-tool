 * instead, and this handler relays the payload — so the only address AppSignal
 * sees is the server's. It replaces the `tunnelRoute` the Sentry setup used.
 *
 * The relay is deliberately narrow: one fixed destination, one allowlisted
 * request header, our own configured key. It is not a general proxy.
